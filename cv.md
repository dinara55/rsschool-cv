## About me

I'm a freelance tax consultant with a growing interest in programming.

Having gained my degree in linguistics and law, I've pursued my career as a tax consultant at one of the Big 4 accounting firms. However, during COVID lockdown I've started considering a career change as I found my job at the company unfulfilling and repetitive.

Programming has always seemed both fascinating and intimidating to me, like a secret land only for the chosen people. Still, there's no harm in trying and now that I have more free time as a freelancer, I finally decided to take it up and see what happens. 

As for the goals, I have two of them in mind. 
The first one is a down-to-earth and realistic one: gain new knowledge, practical as well as highly useful in everyday life. 
The second one is an ambitious one: go for a career change and land the first job as a frontend developer in a year (i.e. September 2023), certainly if I develop a long-standing and keen interest in programming.

Speaking about my relevant **strengths**, I would single out strong analytical skills, logical thinking, good organization/learning and time-management skills, good communication and teamwork skills, great attention to details, ability to work under pressure and tight deadlines (backed by my work experience in a highly competitive and stressful sphere), creativity.
